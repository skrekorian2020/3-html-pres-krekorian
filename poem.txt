FAMILY:
They taught me what I needed to know, I turned to them for everything
She taught me how to compete, be confident, and work hard
He taught me how to step up under pressure
And she taught me to embrace my sensitivity instead of suppressing my emotions
When it was time for them to go to school, I was on my own
I used what I learned from them to become my own unique person
